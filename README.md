# Rubus
Rubus means an application layer protocol, a client reference implementation, and 
a server reference implementation. These parts constitute a video streaming service.
The end user can configure the server side and the client side and use the service by
themself. As a different scenario, the user can set up only the server side and provide
the configuration parameters so other people can access it.
